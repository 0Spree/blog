<p id="about-p">My name is Andreas Kousholt, I grew up in a small town in Denmark. Since I was able to walk, I have always loved Computers, it started as watching my bigger brother playing RuneScape and then me playing Call Of Duty 3 on my Xbox 360.
As I got older I wanted more and more to do with electronics, I build my first computer and I liked it, but I wanted something more! Then I tried programming and I loved it! It started off as a little HTML website, where it could guess your age by asking some mathematical questions.</p>
